## Conclusion

After going around and checking out open source selfbots, I noticed that all that I checked didnt have file based command separation.
I can see why no one would do it since most would do it with `load_extension` (discord.py docs), and that requires an openly exposed .py file.
Basically compiling as closed source is not possible that way.

Primrose uses a different approach that is organized and compilable without exposed source code when compiled.

Primrose like any other selfbot is against Discord's ToS, and I am not responsible for any bans you may get.

This is my first open source project, and I am facing that fact that there will be code I might get laughed at, but I am here to learn and maybe even teach or inspire others.

I am also not a professional programmer, so I am sure there are many things I can improve on, and I am open to suggestions.
